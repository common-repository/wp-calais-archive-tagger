Goes through your archives and adds tags to your posts based on semantic analysis.

== Description ==

The Calais Archive Tagger plugin automatically goes through your archives and tags every post you've written. The plugin uses the Open Calais API to perform semantic analysis of your post text and suggest tags. If a post already contains a suggested tag, that tag isn't added, but other new tags found are. It takes about 5 minutes to tag 200 posts.

This plugin requires <b>PHP 5</b> and the cURL library (both of which are available on most web hosts).

Also see <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/calais-auto-tagger/">WP Calais Auto Tagger</a> for suggesting tags as you write new posts.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What's new in version 1.1 =

The script now sleeps for half a second between posts to ensure you stay within the current Calais API rate limits (2 requests per second and 40,000 requests per day).

I've also wrapped the API call in a try/catch block so that any exceptions don't cause a loop condition.

= What's new in version 1.2 =

The plugin now ensures no manually added tags are lost when adding new tags. E-mail addresses are no longer added as tags.

= What's new in version 1.3 =

Updated opencalais.php to support new entity types.

= What's new in version 1.4 =

Updated opencalais.php to use new API URL and support new entity types.
